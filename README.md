This module requires PowerShell 7 and has a dependency on the [pwshSpectreConsole]() module. This requirement will be installed automatically if you don't have it already.

```powershell
Install-PSResource PSPodcast

This is a relatively simple module designed to get and display information about recent episodes of [The PowerShell Podcast](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/).
